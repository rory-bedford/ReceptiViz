* 1D plots not always working
* Update CONTRIBUTING and git actions to include development branch, and change repo settings so you can't push to main directly
* Write mathematical appendix
* Improve unit test coverage and test receptive field estimation followed by encoding (with appropriate error ranges)
* Implement fft version
* Implement decoder
* Improve plot_manager performance - maybe load all subarrays so we only slice what's necessary at each interaction not the full array
