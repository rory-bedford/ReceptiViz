Receptual documentation
=======================

Receptual is a simple tool for computing and visualising neuron receptive fields and decoding filters.

Linear encoding and decoding methods are essential for understanding the relationship between neural activity and sensory stimuli. They are widely used in systems neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and mechanistic interpretability for deep learning.

We provide fast NumPy + SciPy implementations of the following algorithms:

- Receptive field estimation
- Activity encoding

We also provide an interactive OpenGL + Qt 3D visualisation tool so you can graphically interpret the relationships between your neural activity and stimuli.
